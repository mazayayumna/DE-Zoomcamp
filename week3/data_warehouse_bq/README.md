# OLAP vs OLTP

* ***OLTP***: Online Transaction Processing.
* ***OLAP***: Online Analytical Processing.

OLTP systems are classic databases
OLAP systems are catered for advanced data analytics purposes.

|   | OLTP | OLAP |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Control and run essential business operations in real time | Plan, solve problems, support decisions, discover hidden insights |
| Data updates | Short, fast updates initiated by user | Data periodically refreshed with scheduled, long-running batch jobs |
| Database design | Normalized databases for efficiency | Denormalized databases for analysis |
| Space requirements | Generally small if historical data is archived | Generally large due to aggregating large datasets |
| Backup and recovery | Regular backups required to ensure business continuity and meet legal and governance requirements | Lost data can be reloaded from OLTP database as needed in lieu of regular backups |
| Productivity | Increases productivity of end users | Increases productivity of business managers, data analysts and executives |
| Data view | Lists day-to-day business transactions | Multi-dimensional view of enterprise data |
| User examples | Customer-facing personnel, clerks, online shoppers | Knowledge workers such as data analysts, business analysts and executives |

# Data Warehouses
A **Data Warehouse** (DW) is an ***OLAP solution*** meant for ***reporting and data analysis***. Unlike Data Lakes, which follow the ELT model, DWs commonly use the ETL model.

A DW receives data from different ***data sources*** which is then processed in a ***staging area*** before being ingested to the actual warehouse (a database) and arranged as needed. DWs may then feed data to separate ***Data Marts***; smaller database systems which end users may use for different purposes.

# Big query
## External tables

An ***external table*** is a table that acts like a standard BQ table. The table metadata (such as the schema) is stored in BQ storage but the data itself is external. Can create an external table from a CSV or Parquet file stored in a Cloud Storage bucket:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']
);
```

This query will create an external table based on 2 CSV files. BQ will figure out the table schema and the datatypes based on the contents of the files.

Be aware that BQ cannot determine processing costs of external tables.

You may import an external table into BQ as a regular internal table by copying the contents of the external table into a new internal table. For example:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitoned AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

## Partitions
BQ tables can be ***partitioned*** into multiple smaller tables. For example, if we often filter queries based on date, we could partition a table based on date so that we only query a specific sub-table based on the date we're interested in. It improves performance and reduce costs.

You may partition a table by:
* ***Time-unit column***: tables are partitioned based on a `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, or `DATETIME` column in the table.
* ***Ingestion time***: tables are partitioned based on the timestamp when BigQuery ingests the data.
* ***Integer range***: tables are partitioned based on an integer column.

>Note: BigQuery limits the amount of partitions to 4000 per table. If you need more partitions, consider clustering. Here's an example query for creating a partitioned table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
PARTITION BY
  DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

Querying a partitioned table is identical to querying a non-partitioned table, but the amount of processed data may be drastically different. Here are 2 identical queries to the non-partitioned and partitioned tables we created in the previous queries:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';
```
* Query to non-partitioned table.
* It will process around 1.6GB of data/

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';
```
* Query to partitioned table.
* It will process around 106MB of data.

You may check the amount of rows of each partition in a partitioned table with a query such as this:

```sql
SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM `nytaxi.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
WHERE table_name = 'yellow_tripdata_partitoned'
ORDER BY total_rows DESC;
```

This is useful to check if there are data imbalances and/or biases in your partitions.

## Clustering

***Clustering*** consists of rearranging a table based on the values of its columns so that the table is ordered according to any criteria. Clustering can be done based on one or multiple columns up to 4; the ***order*** of the columns in which the clustering is specified is important in order to determine the column priority. It improve performance and lower costs on big datasets.

>Note: tables with less than 1GB don't show significant improvement with partitioning and clustering; doing so in a small table could even lead to increased cost due to the additional metadata reads and maintenance needed for these features.

Clustering columns must be ***top-level***, ***non-repeated*** columns. The following datatypes are supported:
* `DATE`
* `BOOL`
* `GEOGRAPHY`
* `INT64`
* `NUMERIC`
* `BIGNUMERIC`
* `STRING`
* `TIMESTAMP`
* `DATETIME`

A partitioned table can also be clustered. Here's an example query for creating a partitioned and clustered table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;
```

Just like for partitioned tables, the _Details_ tab for the table will also display the fields by which the table is clustered.

Here are 2 identical queries, one for a partitioned table and the other for a partitioned and clustered table:

```sql
SELECT count(*) as trips
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  AND VendorID=1;
```
* Query to non-clustered, partitioned table.
* This will process about 1.1GB of data.

```sql
SELECT count(*) as trips
FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitoned_clustered
WHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'
  AND VendorID=1;
```
* Query to partitioned and clustered data.
* This will process about 865MB of data.
